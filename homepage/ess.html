        <h1>The Parks Influence</h1>
        <p class= para1>I arrived in America when I was four years old to where I still live today, Brooklyn, New York. The same weekend of me arriving, my father brought me to Heckscher Playground, better known as Linden Park. The park itself looked as if it hadn't seen someone to clean or fix it for decades: half of the basketball court’s paint had faded away, the rims’ nets were barely hanging on, and the playground could have almost been considered dangerous with how wobbly and shaky it felt as soon as someone stepped one foot on it. That changed three years ago when the nearby church raised enough money to put the park under construction and make it look like the more modern park that's there now. The changes to the park may have made it look different, but it couldn’t change what goes on in the park itself. </p>
        <p class= para2>Ever since that first time at the park, I just couldn't stop going. My entire life I have been going there to play basketball, but more importantly it was there that I met some of my best friends at the time. We all grew up together and influenced one another an unbelievable amount. It came to the point where we were all almost the same person. We loved the same things, hated the same things, did the same things. I knew that if I felt a certain way about anything, they would feel the same. In school we all got decent grades which were not anything to brag about but they were definitely not terrible. Financially, our situations were also similar. Everything between us was almost exactly the same. Everything except that after we were all done playing basketball they walked a few feet to their homes, which were the projects that surrounded the park, while I had to walk a few blocks to my house. That being said, with all these things being similar about us, we still ended up becoming so different.
        <p class= para3>Even after reconstructing the park, one thing sadly couldn't be changed about it: the amount of crime and negative influence that was there. If you ever came to the park you would see a bunch of gang members as soon as you were walking in. A guy counting his money after he sells some type of drug to a group of people, who came by to see if there is anyone selling the drugs. Then there's some guy half dressed sleeping on the park’s bench after passing out there the day before when he finished spending the money he had on the bottles of Hennessy he drank by himself. That is the reason that my friends and I ended up so differently.
        <p class= para4>As much time as I spend in the park and around all the influence there, I can ultimately get away from it. I simply have to walk home. The friends I had there, lived there. That was the only influence that they were around. They were constantly around all of it, and there was no way they could get away from it. The park's negative influence made it almost impossible for them to end up on the right path. Living in the projects put them at a disadvantage. It became almost inevitable that they would learn from those they had around them, because they didn't have anyone to contradict what they were taught living there. Now all of those friends I had there are either in gangs, drug dealers, or drug addicts. One of those people was Shawn.
        <p class= para5>Shawn and I were best friends for a long while. We did absolutely everything together. If I was going somewhere I asked if he wanted to come with me. We always had to go to the park together. Where there was Marcos, there was Shawn and vice versa. We were always competing with one another when it came to grades, sports, anything we could compete in. The competitiveness between us caused us to want to learn from each other. If one of us was better at something than the other, what better way to catch up than simply do what the other one does but better. It was truly one of the best times in my life. Just knowing that I was growing as a person, while I helped someone else do the same and vice versa. It was during the summer vacation last year that I found out Shawn had been killed in a shootout not too far from Linden Park by a rival gang member.
        <p class= para6>Writing this, I ask myself if I would still be writing it if I lived in Linden Park’s Projects. Thinking about it now, that's a definite no. A better question is, would I still be alive, above the ground or dead, buried 10 feet beneath it?
