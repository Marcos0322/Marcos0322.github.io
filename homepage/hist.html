    <h1>Why the Park</h1>
    <p class= para1> Linden Park is the perfect representation of my New York as it shows how differently people can end up from a few life choices or just circumstances that may be completely out of their control. In the essay I explain how living in the projects that surrounded the park which there was constantly negative influence affected the friends I had there, and their futures. I explained how living only a few blocks away might have been the reason I am who I am today, and didn't fall into doing "bad" things and what kids were learning to do in the projects. In the images that you'll see of the park it might look like a very nice park and if you saw it, you may even spend a bit of time in it. However the park didnt always look like that. Only 3 years ago, that same park would have looked like a dumpster more than a park. The playground was shaky and dangerous, the soccer field and track would have been just been a regular cement floor, and the basketball court would have had cracks everywhere with hoops that had broken nets or nets that were gone all together. Thankfully the nearest church to the park raised money to renovate the park and make it look like the more modern and nice park that stands there now, but the renovation couldn't change one thing, what goes on in the park. The park is filled with gang, drug, and crime activities. All of the friends that I've had in the park have ended up in some sort of illegal activities or others dead. After thinking about it I came to the conclusion that the only reason why I was able to "escape" all of that negative influence was because instead of living 2 minutes from the park, I lived 10 minutes from the park. This tiny difference is what allowed me to distance myself from the negative influence of the park but the friends I had at the park had the park as their backyard so they were constantly around that influence. That why the park is my New York, because it reminds me how lucky I am and how much I should appreciate the position I'm in because something that my friends and I couldn't even control may have been the difference that caused us to end up so differently. </p>
