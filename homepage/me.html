    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class= aboutme> My name is Marcos Moya, Im 16 years old, and live in Brooklyn, New York. I have a pretty big family in which I am the youngest of 3 siblings. I came to the United States when I was 4 years old, and its become my home ever since. Since the beginning I have loved Math and Science, so Compter Science was almost an obvious extracirricular that I knew I would eventually take, which is what has led me to create this website. My greatest strengths are my dedication and enthusiasm. I would say these are my greatest strengths as I have noticed that approaching new things with enthusiasm has been the most important thing to improving in whatever it may be and dedication is what has allowed me to continue this improvement long term. An area of growth is my organizational skills. I can definitely improve at staying more organized as Iâ€™ve noticed that it can make things a lot more stressful and makes it easier to lose track of things. I love to play sports, video games, and like anyone else I love food. My favorite sport at the moment is basketball, my favorite video game is one based on basketball called NBA 2K, and my favorite food is steak. I live in Bushwick, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, which is very diverse but frankly not the safest neighborhood. In the essay you kind of see some parts of that with the park which is why the park does represent my New York.
